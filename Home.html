  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a results-oriented Android & Full-Stack developer with 2+ years of experience building
    high-performance mobile and web solutions. From Kotlin, Jetpack and Room to C#, .NET and Azure,
    I love turning ideas into scalable, user-centric products. My background in Biochemistry &
    Bioinformatics gives me a unique problem-solving lens, while agile teamwork keeps me learning every day.

    <div class="about-mission">
      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>
        My mission is to harness the power of software development to create meaningful solutions that improve lives 
        and make everyday tasks easier. I believe technology should serve humanity, removing barriers and creating 
        opportunities for progress. Whether building mobile applications that connect communities or enterprise systems 
        that streamline operations, I'm committed to developing tools that move us forward collectively. Every line of 
        code I write is an opportunity to contribute to a better, more efficient, and more connected world.

      <h3>Values</h3>
      <p>
        I'm driven by core values that shape both my work and life. Community is at the heart of everything I do—from 
        volunteering at local shelters to building apps that bring people together. I believe in effective communication 
        as the foundation of successful collaboration, ensuring that ideas translate into action. Hard work isn't just 
        effort; it's dedication to excellence and continuous improvement. Giving back to society through service and 
        mentorship is essential, as is loving the work you do—passion fuels innovation and creates lasting impact.
